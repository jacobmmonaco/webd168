      The picture above shows my girlfriend and me during a hike on Catalina
      Island this summer. This was taken before I started learning anything
      about web development. Fast forward to October, I’m now a couple of months
      into learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and Python, and I'm really
      enjoying the process.

      I’m excited to begin the second class on HTML and CSS. In the first class,
      I created a mock website for a resort, which I found both a challenge and
      rewarding. The experience opened my eyes to the possibilities of web
      development, and I’m eager to continue learning more advanced techniques.

      Lately, I’ve realized that I enjoy front-end development the most. I love
      the creativity involved in designing user interfaces and making websites
      visually appealing. I have even started designing a website for my parents
      small business. So far I'm liking how it's coming out but it definitely
      needs a bit more work!
